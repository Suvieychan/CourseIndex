            <h1>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h1>
            <p>In both articles it states that big companies are trying to in some sort buyout all the smaller companies that are helping other small designers. In some what it's kind of like gate keeping only for them to benefit having all the high end programs and causing people to pay for subscriptions by making it hard to get. what used to be small companies are now being bought out by big companies to boost profit and sales and make it hard for small designers now.</p> 

            <p>I say i would integrate more flexibility to everything. When it comes to trying new programs and systems to make work easier and more useful. From learning more programs and enhancing my skills to even maybe one day making a program of my own for others to use and utilize. Having creativity is very important in design and an open mind to new thing s is definitely a bonus.</p>

            <h1>Reading Discussion II:Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h1>
            <p> 1. Lialina’s definition of a universal user in understanding Schwulst advocating for individual websites over platforms. As mentioned by Lialina universal users have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the application or device used. It is shown to be that the user needs more ideas and need to think more out of perspective making more of a individual experience. In this way it it can be ralates to Schwulst’s ideas to individualize websites for the user itself and not for large coororations when large companies utilize the websites for advertising needs to benefit themselves and garner them money versuse the user, causing the user to be trapped in an experience with all ads.</p>
            <p>2. In my opinion I somewhat would agree I am a universal users. I tend to spend a lot of time on a computer with certian apps and programs. In terms of having to compare with the article i do admit i use multiple browsers for the same thing. there was a part in the article that I would say caught me really good and it just when I use two browsers for two different accounts, sometimes in incognito just because I feel certian programs are tooo complex for me. After reading the article it shows me that there are endless oportunities available in the world lide web and as a universal user. </p>

            <h1>Reading Discussion IV: In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h1>
            <p>Surveillance can be interpreted in many ways. Usually, when you think of surveillance it is when someone keeps an eye on you or just cameras watching your every move or even just be as simple as data collection. in today's modern age surveillance has been much more high tech and advanced than you never even know who or what is watching. You could be having a simple conversation with your friends about something you want to get and moments later you get ads about that item on social media and your search engines. It's incredible how surveillance has become over the years since the technology was introduced. The way everything is now is more so for marketing and research for eCommerce or any retail goods but the information and the privacy is something that should be taken into more careful consideration as now people just skim fine print when using technology and just go about their daily lives without know what they are agreeing upon. something that I consider very relatable from Steyerl's essay would be this quote "new technologies have enabled the detached observant gaze to become ever more inclusive and all-knowing to the point of becoming massively intrusive—as militaristic as it is pornographic, as intense as extensive, both micro-and macroscopic". which explains everything now in the modern era.            </p>
